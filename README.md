# Clean Architecture Flutter Project

![Project Folder Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khaledsawan/clean_architecture_flutter/main/architecture-proposal.png)

## Project Overview

This Flutter project follows the Clean Architecture pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and maintainability. The project is structured into several layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains widgets, pages, and presentation logic (Bloc). Handles the user interface and user interactions.

- **Domain Layer**: Contains use cases and domain entities and abstract Repository.

- **Data Layer**: Manages data sources, repositories, and data models. Responsible for data retrieval and storage. Divided into `repositories`, `model`, `local_data_sources`, and `remote_data_sources`.

## Key Features

## Login Feature

Our application includes a robust login system. Here are the key aspects of this feature:

- **Input Validation**: We ensure that user inputs, such as email and password, are validated to maintain data integrity.

- **Authentication**: Upon entering valid credentials, users are authenticated and granted access to their accounts.

## Signup Feature

Creating an account is straightforward with our signup feature. Key elements include:

- **Input Validation**: Similar to the login feature, we validate user inputs to ensure data accuracy with Image file validation.

- **Create Accout**: Upon entering valid credentials, users are valid to create accout.
