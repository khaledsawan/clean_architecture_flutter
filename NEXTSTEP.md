# Next Steps for Crashlytics Integration

## Crashlytics Overview

### Crashlytics Interface

- **Objective**: Develop a single Crashlytics interface that can be implemented by any crash reporting service. For this project, Firebase Crashlytics will be used as the primary implementation.
- **Benefit**: This approach will allow for easy substitution of other Crashlytics services if needed in the future by adhering to a common interface.

### Firebase Crashlytics Integration

The integration will involve the following steps:

#### 1. Setup Packages

#### 2. Implement Interface in Code

- **Define the Crashlytics interface**
- **Create Firebase Crashlytics Service**:
  - Implement the interface in a Firebase Crashlytics service class.

#### 3. Error Catching and Logging

- **Global Error Handling**:
  - Set up global error handling to catch uncaught exceptions and log them using the Crashlytics interface.
- **Feature-specific Logging**:
  - Add custom error logging within key app features (e.g., network failures, app-specific errors) by calling methods from the Crashlytics interface.
